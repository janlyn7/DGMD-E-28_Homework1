# DGMD-E-28_Homework1

While poking around on w3schools.com, I noticed there was a new CSS framework called W3.CSS, so I decided to try it out for this first assignment.  

And since I can get a Professional license for PyCharm through work, I'm trying it out for developing in HTML.  It's pretty good, and I like that I 
can easily upload a project to GitHub via the PyCharm IDE.
